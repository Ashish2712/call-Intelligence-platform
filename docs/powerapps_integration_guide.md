Power Apps enables reviewers and admins to interact with insights generated by the Databricks pipeline.

## 1️⃣ Goal
Expose Gold-layer insights (`nlp_insights`) to reviewers:
- View transcripts, key phrases, and sentiment
- Assign calls to team members
- Customize monitored key phrases
- Govern access via Azure AD

## 2️⃣ Integration Options

### Option 1: **Dataverse Table**
1. Export `call_intel.gold.v_nlp_insights_rls` (via Synapse Link or Dataflow) to **Dataverse**.
2. In Power Apps → create an app → connect to the Dataverse table.
3. Add filters, gallery views, and forms to:
   - Assign `call_id` to users
   - Edit or review sentiment
   - Flag for further analysis

### Option 2: **Azure Synapse Serverless SQL**
1. Expose your Delta tables directly:
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM OPENROWSET(
     BULK 'https://<your-adls>.dfs.core.windows.net/gold/nlp_insights/',
     FORMAT = 'DELTA'
   ) AS [result];
